QC Medals addon for QC: Doom Edition

All credits for realizing this addon go to Ivory Duke.
Medals in this addon not necessairly work the same way as in QC, most of that is intentional to reduce medal clutter.

NOTE: This addon aims to work with Q-Zandronum 1.3 and is not compatible with GZDoom or Zandronum, nor with older versions of Q-Zandronum

qzan_v1.3 changes from 1.2:
	- DECORATE modifications to make the addon compatible with Q-Zandronum and QC:DE 2.7 (QCDEv2.7.pk3 /w qcdeqzpatch2.7.pk3)
	- Daniel's Painkiller weapon now treated as a Gauntlet, thus melee kill yields HUMILIATION
	- Moved MIDAIR, PRECISE and POINT BLANK medals to be triggered only on frag, not on hit
	- MIDAIR now checks if victim was airborne in a different way
	- POINT BLANK is now based on distance from the victim
	- First Blood now triggers on the first actual kill, not when the first player hits 1 frag
	- DIE HARD now triggers on frag event instead of constantly checking player health, lowered activation threshold to 15 HP
	- PERFORATED will now trigger correctly even if the player recieves 1000000 hp damage from other source than telefrag (ex. DamageThing)
	  (unless someone is entering a two-way teleport you are exiting from, as the corpse gets teleported, the check fails and it will give RING OUT)
	- Added STOPWATCH medal
	- TANK will now not be given in (T)LMS modes when the round starts
	- Added missing FROM THE GRAVE assets to fix it not displaying
	- Added missing MIDAIR sound
	- Fixed DENIED being given also for suicide
	- Fixed RING OUT being yielded for every frag in instagib
	- Fixed close range instagib frag possibly giving PERFORATED
	- Fixed HUMILIATION being given based on gauntlet firing (ex. Dave kills when gauntlet spinning gave medal)
	- TANK will now trigger on 25 points of overstack, players need to lose both overstacks for it to be able to retrigger
	- POWERUP MASSACRE frag requirement reduced 10 -> 5
	- Added MENUDEF entry for toggling 'cl_qcmedals' under QCDE Hud options
	- Fixed setting 'cl_qcmedals false' not switching every medal off
	- Fixed Nyx getting RING OUT for a ghost walk kill
	- Included RailJump addon, server switchable with 'sv_railJump'
	- New ability medals: GET PSYCHED, CURSED, SEER, JUNKIE, PINEAPPLE, INSIDE OUT, SLAYER, STOMPER, SHOCKER
	
bugfixes of newly introduced features:
	- Fixed Sarge occasionally getting STOPWATCH on (T)LMS round start
	- Fixed STOPWATCH being given rapidly repeatedly when Heavy Armor could not be picked up
	- Reduced network impact of new MIDAIR check significantly
